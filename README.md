# Academy Directory

--------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

* Academy Directory (AD) is a desktop app for CS1101S tutors to manage studentsâ€™ 
  contact, grades, tutorial attendance, and assignment completion. 
  It is optimized primarily for usage in teaching CS1101S - Programming Methodology I, at the National University of Singapore.<br>


* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) 
    than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.

  * It is optimized for CLI usage and suitable to fast typists.
