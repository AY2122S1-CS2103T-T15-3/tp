### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academydirectory/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academydirectory/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academydirectory/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academydirectory/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academydirectory/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AcademyDirectoryParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AcademyDirectoryParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AcademyDirectoryParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academydirectory/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the academy directory data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AcademyDirectory`, which `Student` references. This allows `AcademyDirectory` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academydirectory/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both academy directory data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AcademyDirectoryStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.academydirectory.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### AttendanceCommand

This command serves to update the attendance status of students. A student's `Attendance` can be either attended or unattended.

#### Implementation

`AttendanceCommand` will extend the `Command` class and will consequently `@Override` the `Command#execute()` method to serve the aforementioned purpose.

The attendance mechanism is facilitated by adding a `StudioRecord` parameter to the `Student`. This `StudioRecord` has an `Attendance` object which we can use to track and update the `Attendance` of the `Student`. `Attendance` implements `Information` and the actual storing of the attendance status is done with a `boolean array`.

The following sequence diagram describes what happens when `AttendanceCommand` is executed:

![AttendanceCommandSequenceDiagram](images/logic/commands/attendancecommand/AttendanceCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

As seen from the diagram, the `AttendanceCommand` involves two for loops. In each of the loops there is a reference frame.

For `IndexWithinRange` and `UpdateModelAttendanceSequenceDiagram`, the sequential diagrams are as follows:

![IndexWithinRangeSequenceDiagram](images/logic/commands/attendancecommand/IndexWithinRangeSequenceDiagram.png)

If the condition is met, a `CommandException` is thrown to let the user know that the `Index` input is invalid.

![UpdateModelAttendanceSequenceDiagram](images/logic/commands/attendancecommand/UpdateModelAttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** There are 2 separate instances of `Student` as we are creating a new `Student` instance. 

### ParticipationCommand

This command serves to update the `Participation` score of students. Following the XP system for CS1101S, each student is awarded between 0 and 500 XP (inclusive) per Studio session.

#### Implementation

`ParticipationCommand` will extend the `Command` class and will consequently `@Override` the `Command#execute()` method to serve the aforementioned purpose.

The implementation is similar to `AttendanceCommand`, with the same sequence diagram being applicable for Participation given that the proper refactoring is done. `ParticipationCommand` has an additional section in the sequence diagram and it is located between the two loops in `AttendanceCommand`:

![ParticipationCommandMarkAttendanceSequenceDiagram](images/logic/commands/participationcommand/ParticipationCommandMarkAttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The logic above is to update the `Attendance` and is only executed in the event that `participationUpdate` is more than 0. Otherwise, it will not run.

### SortCommand

This command sorts the `AcademyDirectory` student list based on their `Participation`, `Assessment` and `Name`. When sorting by `Assessment`, users have the option of sorting by individual `Assessment` or by the average grade among. Users can also choose if they want to sort by ascending or descending.

#### Implementation

`SortCommand` will extend the `Command` class and will consequently `@Override` the `Command#execute()` method to serve the aforementioned purpose.

The sorting mechanism is based on the `List` interface as it sorts the various `FilteredList` instances using `Comparator`. Based on the `attribute` of the `SortCommand` being executed, the `Comparator` differs as shown by the sequential diagram below:

![SortCommandSequenceDiagram](images/logic/commands/sortcommand/SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The reference frame for GetComparator can be found below. It details the selection process based on the `attribute` of the `SortCommand`.

![GetComparatorSequenceDiagram](images/logic/commands/sortcommand/GetComparatorSequenceDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAcademyDirectory`. It extends `AcademyDirectory` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `academyDirectoryStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAcademyDirectory#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current academy directory state in its history.
* `VersionedAcademyDirectory#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous academy directory state from its history.
* `VersionedAcademyDirectory#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone academy directory state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAcademyDirectory()`, `Model#undoAcademyDirectory()` and `Model#redoAcademyDirectory()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAcademyDirectory` will be initialized with the initial academy directory state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single academy directory state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the academy directory. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAcademyDirectory()`, causing the modified state of the academy directory after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `academyDirectoryStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted academy directory state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAcademyDirectory()`, causing another modified academy directory state to be saved into the `academyDirectoryStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAcademyDirectory()`, so the academy directory state will not be saved into the `academyDirectoryStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAcademyDirectory()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous academy directory state, and restores the academy directory to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AcademyDirectory state, then there are no previous AcademyDirectory states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAcademyDirectory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAcademyDirectory()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the academy directory to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `academyDirectoryStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest academy directory state, then there are no undone AcademyDirectory states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAcademyDirectory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the academy directory, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAcademyDirectory()`, `Model#undoAcademyDirectory()` or `Model#redoAcademyDirectory()`. Thus, the `academyDirectoryStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAcademyDirectory()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `academyDirectoryStateList`, all academy directory states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire academy directory.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Documentation, logging, testing, configuration, dev-ops**

* [Documentation guide](Documentation.md)
* [Testing guide](Testing.md)
* [Logging guide](Logging.md)
* [Configuration guide](Configuration.md)
* [DevOps guide](DevOps.md)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* is an Avenger for CS1101S (a tutor in CS1101S is known as an Avenger)

**Value proposition**:

Currently, Avengers are able to utilise Source Academy as a platform to aid in their students'
learning. However, there is no proper feature that allows Avengers to
maintain a nominal roll for their class, or to track their students' performance.

Academy Directory is designed to fill that gap! It is specifically tailored to help Avengers
better manage their students. The app provides ease of communication, and allows Avengers to
track their students' performance, in terms of attendance, participation and assessments.
