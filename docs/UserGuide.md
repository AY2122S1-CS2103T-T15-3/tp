## Overview
Academy Directory (AD) is a **desktop app for CS1101S tutors to manage students’ contact, grades, tutorial attendance, and assignment completion**. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). AD is developed as an evolution of the Address Book 3 application, primarily for usage in teaching CS1101S - Programming Methodology I at the National University of Singapore.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the file _(link to the latest JAR will be available upon completion of v1.3)_ to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Academy Directory.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`attendance`** : Mark a student attendance.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Adding a student: `add`

Avengers will be able to add their students.

Format: `add n/NAME e/EMAIL t/TELE_HANDLE [p/PHONE_NUMBER]`

* `PHONE_NUMBER` is an optional field. The default value is `NA` which stands for "Not Applicable".
* If Avengers do not wish to enter a student's phone number, 
  * `p` tag can be omitted from the command.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AcademyDirectory home folder.

**Q**: What are "Studios" in this application?<br>
**A**: Studios are tutorials held in CS1101S and are essential in aiding the students to improve their grasp on the concepts taught during the lecture.

**Q**: What are "Avengers" in this application?<br>
**A**: ‘Avenger’ is a special term to call a CS1101S tutor. They are the people who organize a Studio session to improve on CS1101S concepts taught in lecture, recording attendance and grades.
The two terms are used throughout the UG in substitute of ‘tutorial’ and ‘tutor’, in consideration of the targeted audience of our application as CS1101S teaching assistants.
